Problem Statement Title: Predicting Diabetes Mellitus Using Patient Data
Objective:
Diabetes mellitus is a major public health concern, requiring early detection and management to prevent serious complications. The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model that accurately predicts the likelihood of a person having diabetes based on various health indicators. By identifying at-risk individuals, healthcare providers can implement timely interventions and improve patient outcomes.

Problem Statement:
[Healthcare Providers or Industry] are facing challenges in efficiently identifying patients with a high likelihood of having diabetes. Using patient data, such as blood pressure, glucose levels, and other relevant health metrics, the goal is to build a predictive model that can accurately determine whether a person has diabetes. The challenge is to leverage available data to develop a reliable model that can assist in early diagnosis and management.

Success Criteria:
Model Development: Build a machine learning model that predicts diabetes with high accuracy, utilizing features from the dataset such as blood pressure, glucose levels, and BMI.

Evaluation Metrics: Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy and confusion matrix to ensure a reliable prediction.

Visualization and Insights: Use data visualizations to explore the relationships between different features and the target variable (diabetes presence), providing healthcare professionals with clear insights into key risk factors.

Actionable Outcomes: Provide healthcare providers with actionable insights to identify high-risk individuals and implement preventive measures effectively.

This model will help [Healthcare Providers or Industry] better understand diabetes risk factors and improve the effectiveness of early intervention strategies, ultimately enhancing patient care and reducing the burden of diabetes-related complications.
